# Rust f√∂r Java-utvecklare

This is a presentation in Swedish that I held in September 2024 at Omegapoint.

The slides are written in markdown and presented using the terminal presentation tool [slides](https://github.com/maaslalani/slides).

[pokeapi-rs](https://github.com/mawkler/pokeapi-rs) was also implemeted in this presentation to illustrate coding in Rust.
